You can find a detailed version of course policies in the fine print section of this syllabus, but the your responsibilities can be summed up as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey Summary - Individual responsibility:\n\n\n\n\nTake responsibility for your own actions.\nBe honest.\nRespect yourself and everyone else! Zero tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind.\nDon’t do things in class that aren’t related to class\nIf you need help of any kind, just ask!\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we have several expectations of you:\n• To read and be familiar with the information contained in the course schedule, logistics, and packing lists.\n• To attend all field sessions unless absences are prior approved by the instructors.\n• To become familiar with the Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils\n• To ask questions.\n• To work together collaboratively and respectfully in groups\n• To come prepared for class every day. Includes proper attire for fieldwork, rain gear, footwear, and your own lunch and drink when necessary (see schedule).\n• To notify us ahead of time if you cannot be present. Please call or text my personal cell phone if you have any issues with the class.\n• To actively participate in discussions in the field.\n• To complete and submit course evaluations.\n• Be flexible. This is a field course. Depending on weather and other conditions we may have to make adjustments as necessary.\n• Be respectful of the diversity of cultures, backgrounds, preferences, and thought of the students and instructors in the class. We all have different ways of approaching and solving problems and this course will be most effective when we honor and celebrate both our similarities and differences.\n• Bring motivation and a positive attitude!\n• Stay on task. We have a lot to accomplish in a fairly short period of time. Pay attention to the task at hand and take your work seriously.\n• Enjoy yourself! Soils are fascinating to study and having the opportunity to spend time in the field with your peers and instructors can be a great experience. It always is for me.",

On Sunday, May 18th, we will be meeting at noon (12pm) in front of Borlaug Hall to load out vehicles and depart for Jay Cooke State Park. On Monday, May 19th, we will have some classroom time as we go over soil morphology, soil-landscape relationships, and soil interpretations at facilities on the Fond du Lac Tribal College campus. Tuesday-Thursday we will be in the field all day, every day regardless of weather. On Friday we will be packing up camp and making one field stop on our way back to campus.\n\n\n4.1.2 Lodging\nWe will be staying at the Jay Cooke State Park Group Camp for 5 nights (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday). Students will be staying in tents and will need (at a minimum) a tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping mat, in addition to everything else required for a week-long field course. See detailed packing list below - there are no space restrictions, so please feel free to pack what you need.\n\n4.1.2.1 Tents\nEverybody will need a tent. Because we will be set up at the Group Camp for 5 nights and will not be able to pack up in the event of inclement weather, all tents should have a full rain fly. Many off the shelf tents do not come with a full rain fly, and instead have no rain fly or a partial rain fly.\n\n\n\nrain fly types\n\n\nIf you have a larger tent and don’t mind sharing, you are certainly welcome to share when we get set up at Jay Cooke. However, we are asking that everybody have a tent in their possession. If you do not have a tent, we will provide one for you from the outdoor center.\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Food\nBreakfast and Lunch will be provided every day during Week 1. Dinner will be provided on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings and cooked in camp.

If separated on the highway the lead vehicle may take the first and most convenient exit or rest stop. ● The lead vehicle will never pull over onto the shoulder of the highway to allow the other to catch up.\n\n\n5.1.3 Driver Responsibilities\n● The driver will only drive if he/she feels well rested and comfortable driving. ● A replacement driver cannot be someone who has been awake just as long or longer than the current driver. ● The driver is not permitted to operate a cell phone or other devices while driving. ● As the driver you are responsible with the safety of your team members and others on the road; if at anytime the driver feels tired or unable to continue to safely drive then they will notify the co-pilot, who will then notify the other vehicle that a change will be made.\n\n\n5.1.4 Passenger Responsibilities\n● The Co-Pilot’s responsibilities are just as important as the drivers. The Co-Pilot will not sleep or “rest their eyes” at anytime during their shift. ● The Co-Pilot will be in charge of the following: navigation, communication with other vehicle, all cell phone or electronic device usage and most importantly staying awake with the driver. ● The Co-Pilot will entertain and check in on the driver periodically to see if they are still fine with driving.",

    "text": "6.8 Mental Health and Stress Management\nAs a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation. These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance and may reduce your ability to participate in daily activities. University of Minnesota services are available to assist you. In addition to campus-wide mental health resources, the CFANS Wellness Navigator, Rose Simon, is available to meet the needs of students as it relates to personal well-being for any reason. If you are interested in meeting with Rose, her webpage shares a bit more about the ways that you can get connected.",

    "text": "6.9 Academic Freedom and Responsibility\nAcademic freedom is a cornerstone of the University. Within the scope and content of the course as defined by the instructor, it includes the freedom to discuss relevant matters in the classroom. Along with this freedom comes responsibility. Students are encouraged to develop the capacity for critical judgment and to engage in a sustained and independent search for truth. Students are free to take reasoned exception to the views offered in any course of study and to reserve judgment about matters of opinion, but they are responsible for learning the content of any course of study for which they are enrolled. Reports of concerns about academic freedom are taken seriously, and there are individuals and offices available for help. Contact the instructor, the Department Head, your academic advisor, the CFANS Associate Dean for Academic Programs and Faculty Affairs, or the Vice Provost for Faculty and Academic Affairs in the Office of the Provost.",

    "text": "6.10 Appropriate Student Use of Class Notes and Course Materials\nTaking notes is a means of recording information but more importantly of personally absorbing and integrating the educational experience. However, broadly disseminating class notes beyond the classroom community or accepting compensation for taking and distributing classroom notes undermines instructor interests in their intellectual work product while not substantially furthering instructor and student interests in effective learning. Such actions violate shared norms and standards of the academic community.",

    "text": "6.11 Scholastic Dishonesty\nYou are expected to do your own academic work and cite sources as necessary. Failing to do so is scholastic dishonesty. Scholastic dishonesty means plagiarizing; cheating on assignments or examinations; engaging in unauthorized collaboration on academic work; taking, acquiring, or using test materials without faculty permission; submitting false or incomplete records of academic achievement; acting alone or in cooperation with another to falsify records or to obtain dishonestly grades, honors, awards, or professional endorsement; altering, forging, or misusing a University academic record; or fabricating or falsifying data, research procedures, or data analysis. (see Student Conduct Code Section 6.2). If it is determined that a student has cheated, he or she may be given an “F” or an “N” for the course, and may face additional sanctions from the University.\nThe Office for Community Standards provides a wealth of information on the Student Conduct Code and Scholastic Dishonesty. If you have additional questions, please clarify with your instructor for the course. Your instructor can respond to your specific questions regarding what would constitute scholastic dishonesty in the context of a particular class-e.g., whether collaboration on assignments is permitted, requirements and methods for citing sources, if electronic aids are permitted or prohibited during an exam.",
