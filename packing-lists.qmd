# Lodging, Food, and Packing Lists

## Week 1 (18MAY-23MAY)

### Overview

During week 1, we will be camping at the Jay Cooke State Park Group Camp and traveling to field sites each day. On Sunday, May 18th, we will be meeting at noon (12pm) in front of Borlaug Hall to load out vehicles and depart for Jay Cooke State Park. On Monday, May 19th, we will have some classroom time as we go over soil morphology, soil-landscape relationships, and soil interpretations at facilities on the Fond du Lac Tribal College campus. Tuesday-Thursday we will be in the field all day, every day regardless of weather. On Friday we will be packing up camp and making one field stop on our way back to campus.

### Lodging

We will be staying at the Jay Cooke State Park Group Camp for 5 nights (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday). Students will be staying in tents and will need (at a minimum) a tent, sleeping bag, and sleeping mat, in addition to everything else required for a week-long field course. See detailed packing list below - there are no space restrictions, so please feel free to pack what you need.

#### Tents

Everybody will need a tent. Because we will be set up at the Group Camp for 5 nights and will not be able to pack up in the event of inclement weather, all tents should have a **full rain fly**. Many off the shelf tents do not come with a full rain fly, and instead have no rain fly or a partial rain fly.

If you have a larger tent and don't mind sharing, you are certainly welcome to share when we get set up at Jay Cooke. However, we are asking that everybody have a tent in their possession. If you do not have a tent, we will provide one for you from the outdoor center. 

### Food

Breakfast and Lunch will be provided every day during Week 1. Dinner will be provided on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings and cooked in camp. Dinner on Wednesday and Thursday evenings will be at local restaurants in Duluth (TBD), and you will be responsible for purchasing these two meals. We will be stopping by a gas station/convenience store at least one time per day if you need to purchase snacks or other incidental items. **We will accomodate all dietary preferences**.

### Amenities

There is drinking water and pit toilets (i.e. non-flush) available at the Jay Cooke Group Camp. Showers and flush toilets are available about a 500ft walk from the group camp. There will be no laundry facilities available for week 1.

### Packing List

This is a minimum packing list - you are free to bring anything else you feel that you need.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Read and examine
packing.list = read.csv("packing-list-table-week1.csv")
packing.list = select(packing.list, -1)
colnames(packing.list) = c("Item", "Quantity", "Notes")

# Create the table
kbl(packing.list, format = "html") %>%
  kable_styling("bordered", full_width = F, fixed_thead = T, html_font = "arial") %>%
  pack_rows("Field Clothes", 1, 11, background = "grey80") %>%
